## Abstract

Value Per Token (VPT) — the ratio of business value delivered to tokens consumed — was introduced by ambient-code.ai as a buyer-side efficiency metric for agentic software development. This paper examines whether VPT can be lifted from a task-level code-generation metric to an organizational governance framework for companies operating agent fleets. We find that VPT is the economic expression of context engineering quality, that it maps cleanly onto existing FinOps governance patterns, and that it provides the missing governance layer for b4arena's constitution. We propose a concrete measurement framework and recommend its adoption as a first-class KPI for #B4mad's agent operations.

## 1. Context — Why This Matters for #B4mad

#B4mad operates a multi-agent fleet (Brenner Axiom orchestrator, specialist sub-agents) backed by metered LLM APIs. Every agent session burns tokens. Today, token costs are managed implicitly: context budgets in AGENTS.md files, progressive disclosure patterns, `bd prime` context compression. But there is no governance framework that answers the CFO question: *"Are we getting value from this spend?"*

The b4arena constitution's Principle #6 (Human as Bottleneck) and the 33% budget threshold in Romanov's own operating rules are primitive VPT controls — they limit expenditure without measuring return. A formal VPT metric would transform these from blunt cost caps into precision instruments.

## 2. State of the Art

### 2.1 VPT as Defined by ambient-code.ai

The concept originates from ambient-code.ai's October 2025 article "Tokenomics for Code" [1]:

> **VPT = Business Value Delivered / Tokens Consumed**

The framing is explicitly buyer-side — a counterpoint to the hyperscaler "cost per million tokens" metric. Where cost-per-token measures what you *pay*, VPT measures what you *get*. The article positions VPT as the fundamental unit of agentic economics: "Each token carries AI slop or value. Rarely both."

Key claims from the source material:
- The same model can produce ~50% waste or ~90% utility depending on how carefully you drive it
- Spec-driven and test-driven development are VPT optimization strategies
- FinOps teams need to learn tokenomics; agents need embedded cost awareness
- Cutting corners on VPT now creates sustaining engineering debt later

### 2.2 VPT and Context Engineering

ambient-code.ai's February 2026 article "Toward Zero Interrupts" [2] connects VPT to context engineering without using the term explicitly. The argument: every human interrupt is a VPT-destroying event because it (a) consumes human attention (high-cost tokens in the organizational sense), (b) indicates the agent lacked sufficient context to decide autonomously, and (c) breaks the scaling curve.

This aligns with the emerging consensus from Tobi Lütke (Shopify) and Simon Willison on context engineering — the practice of getting the right information to the right agent at the right time. **VPT is the economic scorecard for context engineering quality.** Poor context engineering → more wasted tokens on confusion, retries, and interrupts → lower VPT. Good context engineering → tokens spent on value-producing work → higher VPT.

The relationship is:

```
Context Engineering Quality → Token Efficiency → VPT
```

Context engineering is the *practice*. VPT is the *metric*.

### 2.3 FinOps as Precedent

The FinOps Foundation's framework [3] provides the governance precedent. FinOps evolved through three phases for cloud spend:

1. **Inform** — visibility into who's spending what
2. **Optimize** — right-sizing, reserved capacity, waste elimination  
3. **Operate** — continuous governance with accountability

Cloud FinOps solved the same problem VPT addresses: engineering teams could spin up resources (then: VMs; now: agent sessions) with no visibility into value delivered per dollar spent. The FinOps answer was unit economics — cost per transaction, cost per customer, cost per feature. VPT is the unit economic for agentic operations.

### 2.4 Industry Signals

- **Gartner (2025):** Over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027 due to escalating costs and unclear business value [2]. VPT directly addresses the "unclear business value" failure mode.
- **Deloitte (2025):** Only 11% of organizations have agentic AI in production; 42% still developing strategy [2]. The gap is an interrupt management (and by extension, VPT) problem.
- **NVIDIA:** Their vertically integrated stack blog acknowledges developers must "strike a balance" between token metrics to deliver quality experiences [1]. VPT formalizes this balance.

## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 Task-Level vs. Organizational VPT

ambient-code.ai defines VPT at the task level: tokens consumed by a single agent invocation producing a single deliverable. Can it be lifted to the organizational level?

Yes, but the numerator changes character:

| Level | Numerator (Value) | Denominator (Tokens) | Measurement |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Task** | Feature delivered, bug fixed, PR merged | Tokens in single session | Per-invocation |
| **Agent** | Tasks completed × quality score | Total tokens over billing period | Per-agent monthly |
| **Fleet** | Organizational output (features, papers, ops) | Total token spend across all agents | Per-organization monthly |

The challenge is quantifying the numerator. At task level, you can use proxies: lines of code that survive review, tests passing, beads closed. At organizational level, you need business metrics: features shipped, incidents resolved, research papers published.

**Our recommendation:** Start with **Beads Closed per Million Tokens (BC/MT)** as b4arena's initial VPT proxy. Every unit of work is already tracked as a bead with priority weights. This gives:

```
VPT_b4arena = Σ(bead_priority_weight × completion) / total_tokens_consumed
```

### 3.2 The Marginal VPT of Organizational Complexity

Does adding an agent role increase or decrease system-level VPT?

The answer follows an inverted-U curve:

**Phase 1 — Specialization gains:** Adding a dedicated research agent (Romanov) to a system with only an orchestrator (Brenner) increases VPT because the research agent can be loaded with domain-specific context, reducing wasted tokens on context-switching within a general-purpose agent.

**Phase 2 — Coordination costs:** Each additional agent adds coordination overhead — inter-agent communication tokens, context duplication, orchestrator decision tokens for routing. At some point, coordination tokens exceed specialization gains.

**Phase 3 — Diminishing returns:** The fleet becomes a bureaucracy. Agents spend more tokens talking to each other than producing value.

The optimal fleet size depends on:
- **Task heterogeneity** — more diverse tasks justify more specialists
- **Context isolation** — agents that can operate with minimal shared state are cheaper to add
- **Orchestration efficiency** — a better orchestrator shifts the curve right

For b4arena's current scale (orchestrator + 2-3 specialists), we are firmly in Phase 1. The beads system's low-coordination-overhead design (git-based, async) further extends the specialization phase.

### 3.3 VPT as Governance Layer for b4arena

b4arena's constitution implicitly manages token economics through several mechanisms:

| Existing Mechanism | VPT Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 33% Opus budget threshold (Romanov) | Hard VPT floor — stop spending when marginal VPT drops |
| `bd prime` context compression | Context engineering optimization → higher VPT |
| Progressive disclosure in AGENTS.md | Demand-side token management |
| Bead priority system (P0-P4) | Value weighting for numerator |
| Human as Bottleneck (Principle #6) | Interrupt = VPT destruction event |

What's missing: **the feedback loop**. These mechanisms are static. A proper VPT governance layer would:

1. **Measure** — Log tokens consumed per bead, per agent, per session
2. **Attribute** — Map token spend to value delivered (bead closures, quality scores)
3. **Alert** — Flag when an agent's VPT drops below threshold (spending tokens without closing beads)
4. **Optimize** — Automatically adjust context loading, model selection, and routing based on VPT trends

## 4. Recommendations

### R1: Adopt BC/MT as the Initial VPT Metric

**Beads Closed per Million Tokens.** Weighted by priority. Measurable today with existing infrastructure (beads + API billing logs). No new tooling required to start.

### R2: Instrument Token Tracking Per Bead

Add token consumption logging to the bead lifecycle. When an agent claims a bead, record the session start. When it closes, record total tokens consumed. This is the minimum viable data pipeline for VPT governance.

Implementation: extend `close-bead.sh` to accept and log a `--tokens` parameter, sourced from the session's API usage.

### R3: Establish VPT Baselines Before Expanding the Fleet

Before adding new agent roles, measure current fleet VPT for one billing cycle. This becomes the baseline against which fleet expansion decisions are justified. If adding an agent doesn't improve system VPT within two cycles, reconsider.

### R4: Treat Context Engineering as VPT Investment

Every improvement to AGENTS.md files, SKILL.md quality, and `bd prime` compression should be evaluated as a VPT investment. Time spent on context engineering is amortized across all future token expenditures.

### R5: Integrate with FinOps Reporting

Structure VPT reporting using FinOps phases:
- **Inform:** Dashboard showing tokens consumed per agent per bead (Crawl)
- **Optimize:** Model selection and routing based on task complexity (Walk)
- **Operate:** Automated VPT-aware orchestration in Brenner (Run)

### R6: Publish VPT Standards to b4arena Constitution

Add a formal principle: *"Token expenditure shall be governed by Value Per Token metrics. Every agent role must demonstrate positive marginal VPT to justify its continued operation."*
